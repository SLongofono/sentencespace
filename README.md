This is a server designed to provide a couple of interesting textual artifacts:

1. Sentence gradients: smooth interpolations between two input sentences.
2. Sentence jitters: little clouds of alternative sentences closely related to an input.

This project is forked from -- and indeed most of the code is from -- the `textvae` repo, which is the code for the paper "A Hybrid Convolutional Variational Autoencoder for Text Generation" by Stanislau Semeniuta, Aliaksei Severyn, and Erhardt Barth. I'm indebted to Semeniuta, et al., for their skill and generosity. If I have tinkered slightly it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants.

I'm indebted also to @richardassar, whose improvements allow this code to run at near-interactive speeds.

You can find the original README in (you guessed it) `ORIGINAL-README.md`.
